## 🎥 Assignment Video

All tasks are explained in detail through a r**ecorded YouTube lecture**.

**Instructions for Students:**

- Watch the full assignment video carefully.
- Write all tasks in your notebook or IDE.
- Implement each problem using **Java arrays, sorting algorithms, and selection concepts**.
- Submit your solutions through the course platform (Moodle) as instructed.

## ✨ Tips for Success

- **Trace manually first:** Draw small arrays and trace each sorting algorithm step by step.
- **Test multiple cases:**
  - Empty arrays
  - Single-element arrays
  - Reverse-sorted arrays
  - Arrays with duplicate elements
- **Check stability:** For algorithms that are stable, verify that equal elements maintain their original order.
- **Analyze performance:** Compare number of comparisons and swaps for different algorithms.
- **Use recursion carefully:** Especially for Merge Sort and any divide-and-conquer tasks.
- **Understand selection tasks:** For k-th smallest element, think conceptually about sorting first, then selecting.

## 🧪 Assignment Tasks

> ⚠️ Task details are provided in the assignment video.
> These exercises are designed to reinforce your understanding of sorting, selection, algorithmic thinking, and Java implementation.

- Implement all five sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- Implement **k-th smallest** element using sorting.
- Test your implementations on **various arrays**, including random, sorted, and reverse-sorted arrays.
- Count and compare **comparisons and swaps** for each sorting algorithm.

## 📌 Notes

- Assignments are **not fully written** here to encourage independent problem solving.
- Focus on **understanding the logic**, not just copying code.
- Tracing and visualizing each step will greatly improve **algorithmic intuition**.

## 💬 Instructor Note (Maryam Refaa Haidar Skaik):

"This is your final assignment of the semester! Take your time to carefully implement, trace, and test your algorithms. Remember, the goal is to **think like a programmer** — understanding the steps and reasoning behind each algorithm is more important than just writing code. Keep practicing, and finish the semester strong! 🌟"
