# ✅ Assignment Solutions – Sorting & Selection Module

This folder contains **model solutions** for the Sorting & Selection assignments in the Java Data Structures Lab.

📌 Solutions were published **after semester completion** for learning and revision.

---

## 📚 Problems Covered

1️⃣ Sort an array by frequency of each element  
2️⃣ Remove duplicates from a Singly Linked List and make it sorted  
3️⃣ Find the closest pair in an array  
4️⃣ Sort a Singly Linked List using Merge Sort  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master array sorting algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge Sort  
- Understand frequency-based sorting and stable ordering  
- Practice in-place and recursive algorithms  
- Handle edge cases in arrays and linked lists  
- Reinforce algorithmic thinking for selection problems  

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Solutions focus on **algorithmic reasoning**, not shortcuts  
- Recursion is used where required (e.g., Merge Sort on SLL)  
- Students should attempt tasks independently before reviewing solutions  
- Always consider **empty**, **single-element**, and **duplicate-containing** inputs
